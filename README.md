# Hey Tux
The Cloud AI is becoming ever more prevalent. Almost every operating system in existence has a digital assistant, but until now there was no acceptable implementation for the best operating system in existance, GNU/Linux. Until now, that is.

Hey Tux is a business facing solution which aims to reinvent scalable query resolution by crowdsourcing answers and offloading CPU cycles. This product will recontextualize paradigms and demonstrate bleeding-edge performance in narrative by revolutionizing the way we consume data.

This product is easy to deploy on your production and development environments, and even easier to use. Its advanced natural language processing understands grammar, and will offload extra processing to external servers to increase energy efficiency and save the environment.

To use this product, simply type:

    hey tux, question...

Into your terminal, where "question..." is whatever you want to know. Our patented algorithm will then direct you to the answer, while maintaining the feel of the Linux community.

##Compilation and setup:
Deployment is extremely easy. Just type:

    bash setup

or 

    chmod +x setup
    ./setup

and enter your root password so the executable can be moved over to your /bin/ folder. 

The installation is now complete, so you can feel good to be contributing to our cloud based solutions and saving the environment. Basically, if you don't use this, you're killing the earth. You god damn nazi.
