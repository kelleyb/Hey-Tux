# Hey Tux
A quick tool I made to help with any questions you have.

So many operating systems nowadays have helpers. We've got Google Now, Cortana, Siri, and more! However, there isn't really one for Linux. This project aims to fix that.

Hey Tux is simple and easy to use! All you need to do is run this:

    hey tux, question...

Where "question..." is whatever you want to know. Tux will then direct you to the answer!

##Compilation and setup:
It's super easy to set this up! Just run the setup file provided using either

    bash setup

or 

    chmod +x
    ./setup

and enter your root password so the executable can be moved over to your /bin/ folder. 

Then you're done! Just think of all the knowledge you will have at your fingertips!
